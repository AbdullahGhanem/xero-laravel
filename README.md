Xero Laravel allows developers to access the Xero accounting system using 
an Eloquent-like syntax.

command from the root of your project.

If you have never used the Composer dependency manager before, head 
to the [Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/) for more information 
on how to get started.

## Setup

will publish the package configuration file.
